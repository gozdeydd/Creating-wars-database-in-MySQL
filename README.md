# Creating-wars-database-in-MySQL


by Gozde Yazganoglu


I have made this database as an assignment for Databases course in my master of Data Science in CUNEF. This is a beginner level relational database. It has been a bit challenging for me to create relations and later to form joins. For this reason I am sharing it because some other beginners can have the same problem and would like to consult. Table only have a few rows but of cours can be filled more.

Please feel free to comment and contribute.
